Imagine a set of people. They each have a distinct consciousness and self awareness and the personal experience is defined by their memory. Now suppose that all of the people share the same memory. That is, they access the same recorded memory. However, at any given point, only one person can record the memory.

Is AI-generated art, art?

When you create a picture using the AI-generated art, it is not so much that you have created the art, but rather you have discovered the art in the grand tree of possibilities return by the model. Even using a purely random number generator, the model has a maximum number of unique images it can output. It is limited its resolution, color depth and other factors that make it unique.

When using a new technique, you are exploring an area of the tree that few others have discovered. A person who limits themself to the presented options, using only images found on the internet, that person has limited themselves to a particular branch of the tree.
